I am currently in the habit of writing papers and assignments in one or two large chunks. I like to marathon write like this because it helps me not to lose the voice of the particular piece that I am writing. So far in my college career I haven't had any truly huge writing assignments, though I did once spend 6 hours in a row on a research paper. 

Writing this way is pretty exhausting and makes me dread big papers because I feel I have to allot a large amount of time to work on them. Honestly, what we talked about in class about writing every day sounds like a good solution to me. Right now I have several writing projects due all around the same time, so it may break up the monotony to write a bit on each of them each day. I also may end up writing a dissertation one day, and I know my current method of writing will **not** work for that piece. I really do enjoy writing, even if it is for school, so the prospect of writing a little each day sounds kind of exciting to me.
