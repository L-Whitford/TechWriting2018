## A Dietetic Student's Guide to Their First Blog Post  
--------
## Introduction
Considering the technologically driven world that we live in today, it should be of no surprise that people generally rely upon the internet to get most of their information. This fact can be frustrating for health and nutrition professionals, as many of their clients would rather trust the results of an internet search instead of the professionals themselves. However, a client's love of the internet can be leveraged for good, and many registered dietitian nutritionists have been taking advantage of this love by using blogging platforms to educate the public. These blogs must be not only accurate, but also must be fun and engaging so that the reader will be encouraged to read on. 

Learning to make an accurate and engaging blog post about food is an important step in the education of a future dietitian. As such, you may be required to post at least once on your own blog for a class assignment. It is helpful for your first blog post to be done under the supervision of a professor, so that you will have a safe space in which to develop and practice this skill, and so you may receive constructive feedback from professors and peers. The purpose of this document is to help you with the setup of your very first blog post, so that you may focus your energy on finding a compelling topic rather than spending hours trying to figure out how to use the blogging platform as I did when I wrote my first food blog.

## Step One: Chosing your Topic

![Use your favorite search engine to find your topic](https://github.com/L-Whitford/TechWriting2018/blob/master/Nondescript%20Search%20Engine.png)
There are a few specific things to consider when chosing your topic: 

When chosing your topic, you first want to consider the audience that you are writing to. What will they want to read about? What sort of information will be helpful for them to know? For example, my first blog post was written for a class I took in Spring of 2018 when I was a junior at college. The blog post was about making good food choices in the cafeteria, something that my peers at school were particularly concerned about. If you are having issues deciding on a topic, just think, what would I want to read about? If you do lots of research about food for your classes, maybe consider looking through your search history to see what topics are relevant to you at the time. Chances are, what you are interested in learning about is something that your peers or your audience may want to know about as well.

Next, you want to find something that not everyone and their dog has written about. It's okay to use other blogs and articles as jumping off points, but you need something that will distinguish your food blog from the rest. What makes your topic or your take on the topic unique?

And finally, you want to pick a topic that is not so narrow that you can't expand on it, but not so broad that a reader will get lost in the topic. Your topic should also be something that not everyone knows, so don't write a blog about how oranges have lots of vitamin C.
## Step Two: Finding a Blogging Platform

Once you decide on your topic, you next need to find somewhere to write up your assignment. There are several good, **free** blog platforms, like my personal favorite, [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/create/?sgmt=gb&utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=Google_WPcom_Search_Brand_Desktop_US_en&utm_medium=cpc&keyword=word%20press&creative=264325718114&campaignid=998785131&adgroupid=53026926367&matchtype=e&device=c&network=g&targetid=kwd-488010762432&locationid=9023724&gclid=Cj0KCQjwlqLdBRCKARIsAPxTGaUT8_oCtkHuC1P8CIAz5rSKRPChFE0azQfxdaZJ1b7A0aKJrepy0KwaAoxXEALw_wcB)


![Wordpress.com is the free blogging platform that I use](https://github.com/L-Whitford/TechWriting2018/blob/master/Screenshot%202018-09-24%20at%2010.33.19%20PM.png)

I like this platform because it has easy set up, I know it is reliable, and you do not have to have any knowledge of coding in order to set up your page. If you decide [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/create/?sgmt=gb&utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=Google_WPcom_Search_Brand_Desktop_US_en&utm_medium=cpc&keyword=word%20press&creative=264325718114&campaignid=998785131&adgroupid=53026926367&matchtype=e&device=c&network=g&targetid=kwd-488010762432&locationid=9023724&gclid=Cj0KCQjwlqLdBRCKARIsAPxTGaUT8_oCtkHuC1P8CIAz5rSKRPChFE0azQfxdaZJ1b7A0aKJrepy0KwaAoxXEALw_wcB) is not for you, simply hop on over to your favorite search engine and do what you do best: ask the internet for help. Once you do all the tedious work of setting up your account, you can now move on to the fun part: decorating your blog.

## Step Three: Aesthetics
Not only is aesthetics a fun word to say, it was my favorite step of the blog-setting-up process *(besides the actual writing, of course)*. To make something aestetically pleasing just means to make it beautiful, and having a beautiful blog is an important part of actually getting people to read it. I don't know about you, but I am highly likely to skip over any information that is presented in plain text, no matter how useful it is. Remember-even though you may be writing to college students, no one wants to read a blog that looks like a textbook. 

When beautifying your blog, you can go as simple or as crazy as you want *(hint: you want the look of the blog to draw in your desired reader, so keep that in mind when designing your page)*. This is your time to get creative and create something that you're really proud of, but don't get so focused on this part that you neglect the content of your blog. One way of quickly making a beautiful banner or logo for your blog is to use an online graphic design website like [Canva](https://www.canva.com). 

![Making a banner on Canva.com](https://github.com/L-Whitford/TechWriting2018/blob/master/Screenshot%202018-09-24%20at%2010.39.40%20PM.png)
There are many different templates to choose from on this website, so you can quickly throw together something pretty and focus in on the meat of your blog: the content.

## Step Four: Content- The Good, The Bad, The Ugly
The time has come. You have picked a cool topic, you have created a pretty little blog banner, and now you are sitting in front of your laptop with a giant, steaming mug of tea and you think... what now? Well, now you actually have to write something interesting! This is when all that deep thought you put into your audience will particularly come in handy, as you will be expected to churn out something that is interesting to them. The actual content of your blog is where you want to spend most of your time. Depending on your topic and the length of your post, you may end up spending anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours or more on the initial writing of your blog *(notice that I use the word "initial" here)*, so be sure to plan out enough time to write something you're proud of.

And please, please, **please** do not neglect to include pictures. I don't care how interesting a topic is, I will not read a blog that doesn't have pictures. But by the same token, you don't want to just have a blog full of pictures and captions *(We're not trying to write a Wikihow here, people)*. Think illustrated chapter book rather than picture book or novel. You want enough pictures to keep it interesting, but not so many that your whole blog is mainly images. Again, you want to publish something you're proud of, and almost anyone who can use a computer mouse can make a blog post full of pictures. And speaking of publishing something you're proud of...

## Step Five: Edit, Edit, Edit
You have chosen your topic. You have made a lovely blog banner and logo. You have wonderful content with just the right amount of helpful images. Time to click publish, right? **WRONG** You, my friend, need to spend some quality time editing. As I said in the last section, you want this blog post to be something you're proud of. This blog post will represent you for eternity on the internet. When I put it that way, doesn't it seem like a good idea to spend some time perfecting your wording?

My best advice for editing is to send the raw version of your blog to *every. single. person. you. know.* Well, that may be an exxageration. But get the input of at least three well trusted peers/ mentors. Fresh eyes on your blog, especially if you have been working on it a while, will help for find spelling errors and parts of your content where maybe the wording gets weird. In addition to have a few friends look things over, it's a good idea to let your blog sit for a few hours or maybe until the next day before you reread it and edit it. Oh, and please make sure everything is spelled correctly and you are using proper grammar. If you happen to struggle in this area, check out some [online resources](https://www.grammarly.com/?q=brand&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brand_f1&utm_content=229882349899&utm_term=grammarly&matchtype=e&placement=&network=g&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3KzdBRDWARIsAIJ8TMTuuVYmaika7OILp4YxuNC5_yW1mJnxegD0l0DBM6RwuUMAzkzKnCkaAqsTEALw_wcB) that can help you! Once you feel confident that your post is fully prepared and edited, you are ready to publish your first blog post!

Congrats! You have officially become a published blogger, and you can now move on to your other, less-fun homework. Hopefully this document will help you get started! If you still have any questions, check out the FAQ section at the end of this post. Oh, and in case you were curious, here is a pic of my very first [blog post](https://foodu421247708.wordpress.com/2018/01/31/conquering-the-caf-a-college-kids-guide-to-eating-well-on-a-meal-plan/)!

## FAQs
Q: What sort of pictures should I include in my blog post?

A: The pictures that you include in your blog post should be A) applicable to the subject and B) look nice. That means that while that glamour shot of your new puppy is adorable, it will likely not fit in the theme of your blog post. By the same token, the pictures should not be hastily taken photos taken on a crappy phone camera. This goes back to what I said earlier about this blog representing you: you want to publish something you're proud of.

Q: How do I cite my sources in the blog form? APA?

A: While APA lends itself well for every other paper you will write, it looks kinda clunky in a blog format. The way I cite sources in my blogging is to imbed the link to the website into the actual text of the blog. There should be an option to do that on any blogging platform (look for an icon that looks like two little paperclips hooked together).

Q: How long should my blog be?

A: Ultimately, the blog length is totally up to you, and should be altered based on subject, audience, etc. But just as a general rule, I try to make mine something the average person could read in 5 minutes or so. Lengthwise, that ends up being about 2 pages worth of words.

Q: Can I use pictures I find on the internet?

A: This one is kinda tricky. Because blogs are in the public eye, and people get real touchy about other people stealing their content, I like to take my own pictures. But hey, maybe I'm just a chicken! If you *really* are in a pinch and need pics from the internet, I would say hit up the free stock photo cites. Or **vigilantly** research how to cite pictures/ whether the picture you want has a copyright.
