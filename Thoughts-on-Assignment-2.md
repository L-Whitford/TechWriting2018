# Thoughts on Assignment Number Two: The Technical Blog
## Lindsey Whitford

Before going into this assignment, I had a little bit of blogging experience already. I had previously written a blog post on my own platform for another class, so the set up was fairly painless. 

One thing I learned from this assignment is that writing a good blog post takes time, especially if it's research based. Because I'm a quick and decisive writer, I expected the posts to take about 30 minutes for a first draft, then just little tweaks later on. In reality, I spent about an hour and a half to two hours per post, which is really not that much in hindsight considering blogging happens to be my favorite type of writing.

One thing I'm still not clear on is how to draw readers to your posts. I understand that you have to have a specific audience in mind, but I'm not sure how to get your posts out there so people can find them. 

In case you couldn't tell from my previous comments, I really loved this project! I thought it was lots of fun, and it was interesting to see what topics everyone chose for their blogs.
